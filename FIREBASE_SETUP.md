```

### 1.3 Healthcare-Specific Settings

- **Location**: Choose closest to your healthcare facilities
- **Default GCP resource location**: `us-central1` or `europe-west1`
- **Enable Google Analytics**: Yes (for security insights)

---

## üîê **Step 2: Configure Authentication**

### 2.1 Enable Authentication Methods

1. Go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**
2. Enable the following providers:

#### Email/Password Authentication

```yaml
Status: Enabled
Email Enumeration Protection: Enabled
Email Link Sign-in: Disabled (security)
```

## üîß **Step 3: Set Up Firestore Database**

### 3.1 Create Database

1. Go to **Firestore Database**
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose **Production mode** for healthcare data
4. Select location closest to your facilities

### 3.2 Healthcare Data Structure

```javascript
// Healthcare Users Collection
healthcare_users: {
  [userUID]: {
    id: string,
    email: string,
    username: string,
    role: 'DOCTOR' | 'NURSE' | 'PHARMACIST' | 'ADMIN' | 'RECEPTIONIST',
    clinicId: string,
    phiAccessLevel: string,
    mfaEnabled: boolean,
    isActive: boolean,
    licenseNumber?: string,
    department?: string,
    lastLogin?: timestamp,
    createdAt: timestamp
  }
}

// Security Logs Collection (POPIA Compliance)
security_logs: {
  [logId]: {
    userId: string,
    action: string,
    timestamp: timestamp,
    details: object,
    ipAddress: string,
    deviceInfo: object
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Healthcare users can only access their own data
    match /healthcare_users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == userId
        && isHealthcareWorker(request.auth.token);
    }
    
    // Security logs - write only, admin read
    match /security_logs/{logId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null 
        && isAdmin(request.auth.token);
    }
    
    // Helper functions
    function isHealthcareWorker(token) {
      return token.email_verified == true 
        && token.email.matches('.*@(health\\.gov\\.za|.*\\.co\\.za)$');
    }
    
    function isAdmin(token) {
      return isHealthcareWorker(token) 
        && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/healthcare_users/$(token.uid)).data.role == 'ADMIN';
    }
  }
}
```

## üì± **Step 4: Android App Configuration**

### 4.1 Download Configuration File

1. Go to **Project Settings > Your apps**
2. Click **Android app**
3. Add app with package name: `com.example.medigrid`
4. Download `google-services.json`

### 4.2 Replace Configuration File

```bash
# Replace the template file with your actual Firebase config
cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json app/google-services.json
```

### 4.3 Verify Configuration

The downloaded file should contain your actual:

```json
{
  "project_info": {
    "project_number": "YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_NUMBER",
    "project_id": "YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID",
    "storage_bucket": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com"
  },
  "client": [{
    "client_info": {
      "mobilesdk_app_id": "YOUR_ACTUAL_APP_ID",
      "android_client_info": {
        "package_name": "com.example.medigrid"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## üìû **Support & Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Errors

```
Error: "Please use your official healthcare organization email"
Solution: Add your domain to the healthcare domains list in FirebaseAuthService.kt
```

#### 2. Permission Denied

```
Error: "Firestore permission denied"
Solution: Check Firestore security rules match your user structure
```

#### 3. Email Verification

```
Error: "Email verification not received"
Solution: Check spam folder, verify domain is in authorized domains
```

### Healthcare-Specific Setup

```kotlin
// Add your healthcare domains to FirebaseAuthService.kt
private fun isValidHealthcareEmail(email: String): Boolean {
    val healthcareDomains = listOf(
        "health.gov.za",
        "yourhospital.co.za",    // Add your domain
        "yourclinic.org.za",     // Add your domain
        // Add more as needed
    )
}
```

## üîí **Security Best Practices**

1. **Never commit** `google-services.json` with real credentials to public repos
2. **Use separate** Firebase projects for development/staging/production
3. **Enable** Firebase App Check for production
4. **Monitor** authentication logs regularly
5. **Update** security rules as your app evolves
6. **Backup** Firestore data regularly
7. **Test** disaster recovery procedures
