# Email Verification System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Inconsistent Verification Code Storage**

**Problem**: Verification codes were stored in memory (`mutableMapOf`) which was lost between app
restarts or when switching screens.

**Solution**:

- Moved all verification code storage to `SharedPreferences` with key `"medigrid_verification"`
- Consistent storage format: `"code_$email" -> "$code:$expiryTime:$isUsed"`
- Codes persist across app sessions and screen navigation

### 2. **Verification Code Validation Issues**

**Problem**: The "Can't access email?" fallback code was always showing as invalid or expired.

**Solution**:

- Fixed code generation and storage synchronization
- Improved validation logic with detailed logging
- Added proper expiry time checking (15 minutes)
- Case-sensitive code matching for security

### 3. **Email Service Simulation**

**Problem**: Users weren't receiving "emails" and weren't aware that the email service was
simulated.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced logging with clear visual separation showing email content
- Added prominent messages about checking logs for verification codes
- Improved "Can't access email?" UI to make fallback codes more obvious

### 4. **Password Reset Code Issues**

**Problem**: Password reset codes had similar storage and validation problems.

**Solution**:

- Applied same SharedPreferences approach for password reset codes
- Fixed expiry time validation
- Improved code display in "Can't access email?" section

### 5. **Quick Login Testing Buttons**

**Problem**: Pre-filled test credentials and testing buttons were confusing for production use.

**Solution**:

- Removed quick login testing buttons
- Cleared pre-filled email and password fields
- Clean login interface for production use

## How the System Works Now

### Email Verification Flow

1. **User Registration**:
    - User registers with email/password
    - 6-digit verification code is generated
    - Code stored in SharedPreferences with 15-minute expiry
    - Simulated email sent via AIEmailAssistant (logged to console)

2. **Code Display**:
    - After 3 seconds, "Can't access email?" section appears
    - Shows the verification code directly as fallback
    - User can paste code using the paste button
    - Code validation is case-sensitive and checks expiry

3. **Code Verification**:
    - When user enters code, it's validated against stored code
    - Checks: code exists, not used, not expired, matches exactly
    - On success: marks email as verified, clears verification code
    - On failure: shows specific error message

### Password Reset Flow

1. **Reset Request**:
    - User enters email address
    - 6-digit reset code generated and stored
    - Simulated email sent with reset instructions

2. **Code Verification**:
    - Same "Can't access email?" fallback shows reset code
    - User enters code + new password
    - Validation checks code validity and expiry
    - On success: password updated, reset code cleared

## Key Files Modified

1. **`LoginScreen.kt`**:
    - Updated `EmailVerificationCard` to use consistent SharedPreferences storage
    - Fixed code generation timing and storage synchronization
    - Removed quick login testing buttons
    - Cleared pre-filled test credentials

2. **`EmailVerificationService.kt`**:
    - Replaced in-memory storage with SharedPreferences
    - Added proper storage/retrieval methods
    - Improved validation logic with detailed logging
    - Fixed code expiry handling

3. **`AIEmailAssistant.kt`**:
    - Enhanced email simulation logging
    - Clear visual formatting for email content
    - Added helpful notes about checking logs for codes

## Usage Instructions

### For Development/Testing

1. Register a new user with any valid email format
2. Check the Android Studio Logcat for the simulated email content
3. Look for the "Can't access email?" section (appears after 3 seconds)
4. Copy the displayed verification code
5. Enter code to verify email

### For Production Deployment

1. Replace `sendEmailViaSMTP()` in `AIEmailAssistant.kt` with real email service
2. Configure proper email service API (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
3. Remove or reduce the fallback code display functionality
4. Update email templates as needed

## Security Features Maintained
